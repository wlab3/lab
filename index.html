LTS-01 Local area network / wireless local area network trainer system:
It is designed to help students understand the basic concepts, modes of operation and protocols involved in networking. The trainer has integrated hardware flow control on panel board for better understanding of different types of LAN topologies involved in networking. The trainer system is provided with windows-based user friendly software with analysis of protocols, different layers, network and measurement of error rate and throughput.
Students can easily do connections in different topologies and can learn actual data transfer either through hardware or through simulated network concept. Facility is provided into system software to introduce errors into packets being sent and analyze the effect of error on different protocols and hence find the effect on through put graph as well.
Trainer and its various types of experimentation using this system. This system works into server-client base. For any topology user has to select one server and select the network type whether it is LAN or WLAN. To understand the topology concept user can connect two or more clients to hardware. Depending on the topology selected user will have option to select protocols for the selected topology. Upon selection of protocol user can then create network of connected computers.
In any network which is created by user server can send or can communicate with any of the clients however clients can communicate only with server, no client to client communication is possible. Transmitter port protocol & network analysis can be done after communication is over between server and clients. Throughput v/s Packet size graph can be plotted for which at least two file transfers should be carried out. This plot can be printed to attach in the lab exercise sheet.
For the LAN network LAN cards must be installed prior to start work on this trainer. For wire less LAN USB ports should be available on the computers which are to be used for experimentation. In WLAN wireless access cards gets connected to computer USB ports and access point gets connected to hardware device.

All networking theory is explained using simulation and animation.
Rapid advances in computer & communication technologies have resulted in the increasing merger of these two fields. The lines have blurred among computing, switching & digital transmission equipment; and the same digital techniques are being used for data, audio & video transmission. Merging & evolving technologies, coupled with increasing demands for efficient & timely collection, processing & dissemination of information, have led to the development of integrated systems that transmit & process all types of data.
These intgrated systems are broadly divided as follows
- DATA COMMUNICATION dealing with transmission, transmission media, signal decoding, interfacing, data link control & multiplexing
- NETWORKING deals with the technology & architecture of communication network
- COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS which covers the architecture as well
as analysis of individual protocols at various layers depending on the hardware & software Network laboratory is designed & developed considering the curriculum offered by Anna University. Trainers offered under network laboratory are designed for students at all level to study and understand all the concepts of data communication, data transfer using serial and parallel ports, Ethernet and wireless LAN with complete protocol understanding and actual hands on with hardware & software with ease.
Network laboratory consists of DCT-03 Data communication trainer kit, LTS- 01 LAN / Wireless LAN training system, L-SIM LAN / WLAN protocol simulator and analyzer software & N-SIM Network simulation software.
The DCT-03: Data communication trainer is a unique trainer kit for the development of exercises and theoretical-experimental courses to understand the basic concept and working of modes and protocols in serial and parallel communication.
The trainer kit consists of functional blocks for serial and parallel communication system.
The trainer kit is highly innovative from a technological as well as an educational point of view. The trainer kit is used as “basic unit” to examine all the peculiar operating standards of serial and parallel communication system. The only external equipments required are two Computers with
serial and parallel communication ports and an Oscilloscope. Utmost care has been laid in the design and quality control of all circuits, to ensure the repeatability of the results of the experiments.
Data communication is a term referred when the sender and receiver are digital devices, which communicate with each other by means of binary information. The objective of this trainer kit is to clear the various aspects of the data communications which comprise of
•
The information source or sender.
•
The medium for carrying information.
•
The information receiver.
•
The communication protocols, which ensure proper transfer of data.
With an increasing demand in information exchange the field of data communication technique is emerging as the only solution, to satisfy the various needs of today’s communication sector and to achieve very high bandwidth along with highest accuracy. The communication media is shifting from analog signal transfer towards digital communication.
With PC becoming the biggest storage devices in digital form, it becomes the main source and destination for information exchange. With rapid growth in both the communication technologies as well as computer hardware and software technologies, these two fields are merged to form a data communication network. Now the digital data is used for data, voice and image transmission.
Depending upon the application the communication link can be of point to point communication between two devices or a multipoint communication between at least 3 devices and data transfer can be serial or in parallel form.

<h1>8. Study of TCP/UDP performance using Simulation tool.</h1>
<h2>AIM:</h2>
To Study of TCP/UDP performance using Simulation tool.
<h2>TOOLS USED:</h2>
Opnet Simulator
<h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
The transport layer protocols provide connection- oriented sessions and reliable data delivery services. This paper seeks to reflect a comparative analysis between the two transport layer protocols, which are TCP/IP and UDP/IP, as well to observe the effect of using these two protocols in a client server network. The similarities and differences between TCP and UDP over the Internet are also presented in our work. We implement a network structure using Opnet Modeler and finally, based on the practical results obtained we present the conclusions-showing the difference between these two protocols and how they work.
The transport layer is not just another layer. It is the heart of the whole protocol hierarchy. Its task is to provide reliable, cost-effective data transport from the source machine to the destination machine, independently of the physical network or networks currently in use.
TCP and UDP are transport layer components that provide the connection point through which applications access network services. TCP and UDP use IP, which is a lower-layer best effort delivery service. IP encapsulates TCP packets and UDP datagrams and delivers this information across router-connected internet works.
The ultimate goal of the transport layer is to provide efficient, reliable, and cost-effective service to its users, normally processes in the application layer. To achieve this goal, the transport layer makes use of the services provided by the network layer. Without the transport layer, the whole concept of layered protocols would make little sense e.g. The Transport Layer prepares applications data for transport over the network and processes network data to be used by applications. It is responsible for the end-to-end transfer of data over the network and is the four of the OSI model. The Transport layer meets a number of functions:
-
enabling the applications to communicate over the network at the same time when using a single device;
-
ensure that all amount of data is receive by the correct application;
-
responsible for fragmentation and reassembly;
-
develop mechanism for handling errors.
Comparison Between TCP And UDP

<h2>Flow controls</h2>
The receiver can signal the sender to slow down.

ACKs, which are used in TCP to control packet flow, are not returned.
<h2>Connection setup</h2>
It takes time, but with TCP reliability is ensured.

No connection is required.
<h2>Guaranteed message delivery</h2>
Returns acknowledgments.

UDP does not return ACKs, the receiver can’t signal that packets have been successfully
delivered.
<h2>Congestion controls</h2>
Network devices can take advantage of TCP ACK to control the
behavior of sender.

If ACK, are missing, the network cannot signal congestion to the sender.

A big difference between TCP and UDP is the congestion control algorithm. For the TCP, congestion algorithm prevents the sender from overrunning the network capacity, while TCP can adapt the sender’s rate with the network capacity and attempt to avoid potential congestions problems.
User Datagram Protocol (UDP), another transport protocol in IP networks, is described e.g. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides an unreliable connectionless delivery service using IP to transport messages between machines e.g. [5]. It uses IP to carry messages, but adds the ability to distinguish among multiple destinations within a given host computer. Is a connectionless protocol which doesn’t provide flow control, reliability or error recovery and the retransmissions of data in case of errors must be ordered by other protocols. UDP is designed for applications that do not have to recompose the data segment that arrives from the sender. In another way, application-level protocols are directly responsible for the security of data transmitted.
Difference from the TCP is that there is no mechanism for error detections. If applications that use UDP doesn’t have their own mechanism for information retrieval can lose those data and be forced to retransmitted again. On the other side this applications are not slow down by the confirmation process and the memory will be available for work much faster.

The main difference between these two protocols is that TCP provides reliability and congestion control services, while UDP is orientated to improve performance.
The most important and common thing that TCP and UDP are using is the ability to set a host-to-host communication channel, so the packets will be delivered between processes running on two different computers. UDP is the right choice for application where reliability is not a must but the speed and performance is. Instead, TCP, even if it takes more time for the processes, has additional functions like same order delivery, reliability and flow control. As future work, we plan to conduct several studies regarding packets routing in computer networks to improve the fairness of data transmissions using different network protocols.
<h2>RESULT:</h2>
Thus the TCP/UDP performance has been simulated successfully using OPNET.

<h1>9.a Simulation of Distance Vector Routing algorithm.</h1>
<h2>AIM:</h2>
To implement the Distance – Vector Routing Algorithm
<h2>APPARATUS REQUIRED:</h2>
1.
VI-RTSIM software.
2.
Personal computer.
<h2>THEORY:</h2>
Distance Vector Algorithm:
❖
A Distance vector routing, each router periodically share its knowledge about the entire network with it’s neighbors.
❖
The three keys to under this algorithm are
1.
Knowledge about the whole network.
2.
Routing only to neighbor.
3.
Information sharing at regular intervals.
Knowledge about the whole work:
❖
Each router shares its knowledge about entire network. It sends all of its collected knowledge about the network to its neighbors.
Routing only to neighbor:
❖
Each router periodically sends its knowledge about the network only to those routers to which it has direct links. It sends whatever knowledge it has.
Information sharing at regular intervals:
❖
The every 30 seconds, each router sends its information about the whole network to its neighbors.
Sharing Information:
❖
LAN’s are connected by router, represented by the assuming A, B, C, D, E and F.
❖
Distance vector routing simplifies the routing process by assuming a lost of one unit for every link.
❖
The efficiency of transmission is a function only of the number of links required to reach a destination. In this, the cost on hop count.
Routing Table:
❖
Each router gets its initial knowledge about the internet work and how it uses shared information to update that knowledge.
❖
The routing table has e columns network lost router ID.
❖
The first block is final destination of packet.
❖
The second block is no of hop count.
❖
The third block is that to which a packet delivers must.
Updating algorithm:
❖
Updating algorithm requires that the router first has one hop to the hop count field for each advertised router.
❖
The router should apply the below rules to each router, if the advertised destination is not in routing table
❖
If next hop field is same, router should replace the entry in the table with advertised one.
❖
If next hop field is same, router should replace the entry in the table with advertised one.
❖
. If next hop field is not the same, advertised hop count is smaller than the one in the table, the router should replace the entry in the table with new one.
❖
IF advertised hop count is not smaller, the router should do no routing.
<h2>PROCEDURE</h2>
1.
Open VI-RTSIM software from desktop
2.
Click the Simulation menu bar
3.
Select the “Distance – Vector Routing Algorithm” option from Routing algorithm menu bar.
4.
Network with routers connected through link is drawn by using option in editor(add router, join link, delete router, delete link, Add caption to link, add caption to router)
5.
Select any two nodes to find the shortest distance between them.
6.
Click the Find path Button to run the program.
7.
Now the shortest paths between the two nodes are calculated.

<h1>9.b Simulation of Link State Routing Algorithm.</h1>
<h2>AIM:</h2>
To implement the Link State Routing Algorithm
<h2>APPARATUS REQUIRED:</h2>
1.
VI-RTSIM software.
2.
Personal computer.
<h2>THEORY:</h2>
Link State Vector Algorithm:
❖
In Link state routing, each router share its information of its neighbors with every other router in the inter-network.
Knowledge about the neighborhood:
❖
Instead of sending its entire routing table, a router sends information about its neighborhood only.
To all router:
❖
Each router send this information to every other router on the internetworking, not just to its neighbors.
❖
If s does so by a process called “flooding” it means that a router sends its information.
Information sharing when there is a Change:
❖
Each router sends out information about the neighbors when there is a change.
Information sharing:
❖
Link state routing process use the same internet work as distance vector algorithm.
❖
Here each other sends its knowledge about is neighbors to every other router in the internet work.
❖
Cost is applied only by routers and not by any other station on a network, if cost was added by every station, instead of by routers alone, it would accumulate unpredictably.
❖
Cost is applied as a packet leaves the router rather then as if enters. Most networks are broadcast networks. When a packet is in network every station, including the router, can pick it up, we cannot assign any cost to a packet.
Link state packet:
❖
When a router floods the network with information about its neighborhood, it is said to be advertising. The basis of this advertising is a short packet called a link state packet (LSP).

Getting information about neighbors:
❖
A router gets its information about its neighbors by periodically sending them a short greeting packet.
❖
If the neighbor responds to the greeting as expected, it is assumed to be alive and functioning.
Initialization:
❖
Imagine that all routers in our sample internet work come up at the same time.
❖
Each router sends a greeting packet to its neighbors to find out the state of each link.
Link – State Database:
❖
Every router every LSP and puts the information into a link-state database.
❖
Because every router receives the same LSPs every router builds the same database.
❖
It stores this database on its disk and uses it to calculate its routing table. If a router is added to be deleted from the system, the whole database must be shared for fast updating.

<h1>10. Simulation of error correction code (like CRC)</h1>
<h2>AIM:</h2>
To implement and check the error detection/error correction techniques in networks using a c program.
<h2>APPARATUS REQUIRED:</h2>
1.
Pc-ino
2.
C/c++compiler
<h2>THEORY:</h2>
Error Detection
•
Bit errors occur in frames due to electrical interference or thermal noise.
•
Detecting errors is one part of the problem; correcting errors is the other.
•
What happens when an error is detected?
•
Two basic approaches:
–
Notify the sender that message is corrupt so the sender can retransmit it; ( most often used in every day applications)
–
Use an error-correcting code to reconstruct the correct message
Transmission Errors
·
External electromagnetic signals can cause incorrect delivery of data
-
· Data can be received incorrectly
-
· Data can be lost
-
· Unwanted data can be generated
·
Any of these problems are called transmission errors
Error Detection
•
Detecting Transmission Errors: basic idea is to add redundant information to a frame that can determine if errors have been introduced.
Error Correction or Error Detection?
•
When error is detected, frame is discarded and resent, using bandwidth and causing latency, waiting for its arrival.
•
Error correction requires additional bit to be sent with every frame.
•
Correction is useful when
•
1) errors are probable or
•
2) the cost of retransmission is too high
Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
CRC is a different approach to detect if the received frame contains valid data. This technique involves binary division of the data bits being sent. The divisor is generated using polynomials. The sender performs a division operation on the bits being sent and calculates the remainder. Before sending the actual bits, the sender adds the remainder at the end of the actual bits. Actual data bits plus the remainder is called a codeword. The sender transmits data bits as code words.
At the other end, the receiver performs division operation on codewords using the same CRC divisor. If the remainder contains all zeros the data bits are accepted, otherwise it is considered as there some data corruption occurred in transit.
<h2>PROCEDURE:</h2>
•
Start the process.
•
Give the data which is the message.
•
Compile and run the program.
•
Enter the received hamming code.
•
The error is corrected codeword.
